# Day #1 of nodeJS learning journey

## Here is what I studied today
- Variables, data types (strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, objects), and console.log.  
- Functions (declaration, expression, arrow functions) and conditionals (if-else, switch).
- Loops (for, while, forEach) and array methods (map, filter, reduce).
